# ansible-server
My ansible setup to initial creation of a server to fit my needs. This is very heavily inspired from [ansible-nas](https://github.com/davestephens/ansible-nas) and there will be much overlap as I am very new to Ansible.

# Services
These are mostly a copy from Ansible-NAS, but with my additions at the bottom. Eventually, this list'll get paired down as there are some duplicates and services I don't know if I want. The ones I added are from parusing [awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) and the [Self-Hosted podcast](https://selfhosted.show/). Some of these services will work best as seperate virtual machines, but that'll be for another day.

# Assumptions
Since you can't netboot a complete Ansible install (or could you? I should look that up), I've made some assumptions on the system this'll be implemented in.

## OS
The OS (as of now) is whatever the most current Ubuntu LTS is. I'm not so much a fan of all the snap stuff they're putting in, so this might change to OpenSUSE or CENTOS Stream in the future.

## File System
ZFS everywhere. Okay, maybe not for the OS just yet. But everywhere else that data'll be, it will have ZFS as the file system. There will be subvolumes that will be created in this setup, so the base setup of the pool is all that's required of the user.
